I am a software developer from Spain. Last years I've been working for IBM Research mainly at IBM Quantum. In the past I considered myself a full-stack engineer but last 6 years I've worked only at backend.

In my free time I enjoy photography and cooking, my coworkers say that my cookies are awesome, not the electronic ones :-)
