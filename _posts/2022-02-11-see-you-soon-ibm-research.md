Four years ago, I joined [IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/). I arrived with some [Impostor Syndrome](https://medium.com/@coreyhowell/impostor-syndrome-are-you-a-real-software-engineer-fbf50f1a444e), expecting to be fired sooner or later. Here we are, four years later, I've worked with many teams on a large variety of projects and gears keep moving.

But today, it comes to an end. This is my last day at IBM Research and [IBM Quantum](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/), not only I wasn't fired but I can say they were four good years. I would like to write down all the amazing successes and finally reveal which will be my next adventure.

**Disclaimer**: Sorry if I don't give too much detail, some projects are under strict privacy rules.

## My time at ETX

### Qiskit Studio

My first stop at IBM Research was ETX. And what the hell is ETX you say? The team in charge of emerging technologies. Basically, we had to help teams of researchers to materialize their projects. Researchers are good at creating new and awesome discoveries, and we helped them to know how to fit that in the market.

After some first days of not being sure where I fitted in, I started to a new proof of concept for IBM Quantum. We built a Visual Studio extension, [Qiskit Studio](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-vscode), which helped people to write quantum programs.

It was an interesting landing into the company, but we had to put the project in the fridge. I had the opportunity to learn a bit more about ANTLR and how to develop a Visual Studio extension though.

### Visiting the USA for the first time, and also Tel-Aviv

I always had the intention to visit the United States, but I was always busy, or something else happened. Problem solved, in August 2018 I had my first visit to the IBM Research labs at Yorktown.

[Axel](https://twitter.com/axelhzf) and I traveled there to do some consultancy work. During my time there I've discussed with my boss about the next project. Some promising technology in development by the lab at Haifa.

I "won" a 21 days visit to Tel-Aviv. There, I helped the team to build a web interface allowing them to show [Debater](https://research.ibm.com/interactive/project-debater/) to the great public. On my side, it was a simple web application that was able to take people's positions on a certain topic. Then we used that data to feed Debater and generate a new speech on the given topic. Speech by crowd :-)

From a technology point of view, I didn't learn a lot, I was pretty conservative, using Java with Spring Boot. But I learned a lot from the team in Israel, working with people from other cultures is always enriching. Also, I am happy that I showed them some new technologies and practices that they adopted. It feels good making a team better.

### Team building at NYC!!!

In January 2019 we had a team-building at Yorktown's lab, and we took advantage to pass some days in NYC as a team. It was a great experience where we learned a little bit more about each other. Something that is really important in remote teams.
