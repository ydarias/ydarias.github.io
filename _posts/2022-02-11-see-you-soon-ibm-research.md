Four years ago, I joined [IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/). I arrived with some [Impostor Syndrome](https://medium.com/@coreyhowell/impostor-syndrome-are-you-a-real-software-engineer-fbf50f1a444e), expecting to be fired sooner or later. Here we are, four years later, I've worked with many teams on a large variety of projects and gears keep moving.

But today, it comes to an end. This is my last day at IBM Research and [IBM Quantum](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/), not only I wasn't fired but I can say they were four good years. I would like to write down all the amazing successes and finally reveal which will be my next adventure.

**Disclaimer**: Sorry if I don't give too much detail, some projects are under strict privacy rules.

## My time at ETX

### Qiskit Studio

My first stop at IBM Research was ETX. And what the hell is ETX you say? The team in charge of emerging technologies. Basically, we had to help teams of researchers to materialize their projects. Researchers are very good at innovating, and we helped them to know how to fit that in the market.

After some first days of not being sure where I fitted in, I started a new proof of concept for IBM Quantum. We built a Visual Studio extension, [Qiskit Studio](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-vscode), which helped people to write quantum programs.

It was an interesting landing into the company, but we had to put the project in the fridge. I had the opportunity to learn a bit more about ANTLR and how to develop a Visual Studio extension though.

### Visiting the USA for the first time, and also Tel-Aviv

I always had the intention to visit the United States, but I was always busy, or something else happened. Problem solved, in August 2018 I did my first visit to the IBM Research labs at Yorktown.

[Axel](https://twitter.com/axelhzf) and I traveled there to do some consultancy work. During my time there I've discussed with my boss about the next project. Some promising technology in development by the lab at Haifa.

I "won" a 21 days visit to Tel-Aviv. There, I helped the team to build a web interface allowing them to show [Debater](https://research.ibm.com/interactive/project-debater/) to the great public. On my side, it was a simple web application that was able to take people's positions on a certain topic. Then we used that data to feed Debater and generate a new speech on the given topic. Speech by crowd :-)

From a technology point of view, I didn't learn a lot, I was pretty conservative, using Java with Spring Boot. That was a smart decision since we had not enought time. We wanted to be ready for the CES event. But I learned a lot from the team in Israel, working with people from other cultures is always enriching. Also, I am happy that I showed them some new technologies and practices that they adopted. It feels good making a team better.

### Team building at NYC!!!

Another thing that I've learned working full remote is that **people "is no people" until you met them in person**. You see blocks of code and comments in a repository, but you don't know the stories behind.

There are a lot of remote practices you can use, but in the end, face to face time is the best way to break barriers. No matter how much empathy you have, there is a great difference after meeting in person. That time together helped us to "put a face" at each commit and PR, making collaboration better.

I will not lie, besides the incredible cold, they were a very nice vacations also. Part of the Spanish team stayed together at Manhattan, making the visit awesome.

### Sometimes things don't go as planned

One thing that usually happens at teams like ETX is the idle time between projects. It takes time to find the next best project to collaborate. In my case, when that happened I always returned to IBM Quantum to make a short collaboration.

But time passed and the next promising project appeared. So I finished my tasks at Quantum and started a collaboration with Kui. The first demo that we saw convinced us that we had a great tool to work with Kubernetes clusters. Something pretty similar to Lens.

This was the first (and last) time that I've worked as project manager. I discovered at this project that I am a terrible project manager. My experience as a tech lead, in the past, was good. But when it comes to handling people with controversial points of view, my results are not so good. 

My modus operandi avoids confrontation, and that works well as tech lead were I can lead by example. I do something that works and people follow because it works. But when it takes long discussion times and ...

TBD - Integration of QC anc QX jobs at the same DB collection gets you a travel to Zurich as a prize.

## Finally at home

After some collaborations, the time to join 100% to the Quantum team arrived.

TBD - Being Jiminy Cricket ...
